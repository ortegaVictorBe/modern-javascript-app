# Modern Java Script - BeCode

## Brief :clipboard:

Previously i made a [Weather app (Under construction)](https://github.com/ortegaVictorBe/weatherApp.git), connecting to API [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) , for display the daily wather and 5 days forecast, and i used a live city from a json file that contains a cities catalog :smoking: .
